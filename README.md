## Our Vision
Every Connecticut resident has access to a meaningful career pathway and the support needed to fulfill their aspirations. Every business in Connecticut has access to a skilled workforce.

## Our Mission
To build the systems, teams, and approaches that will make Connecticut a talent environment that attracts and motivates students, career builders, and companies alike.

## Our Approach
The Governor’s Workforce Council was established by Governor Ned Lamont through Executive Order #4 on October 29, 2019 and charged with advising the Governor on workforce matters and developing plans and overseeing the coordination of all government agencies engaged in workforce matters. The 24-member, businessled Council is complemented by 20 non-voting ex officio members. (See Appendix.)

The Council is comprised of several committees with responsibility for leading our work and making recommendations to the full Council. The Office of Workforce Strategy (OWS) within the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) has responsibility for supporting the Council’s work and also for advising the Governor and coordinating workforce related activities across all government agencies.

Our plan is the result of a yearlong process that involved hundreds of volunteers from businesses, educational institutions, community organizations, workforce boards, labor unions, nonprofit service organizations, and philanthropies, as well as countless staff members of our government agencies.

We did our best to engage with as many Connecticut stakeholders and partners as was practical and safe given the circumstances. This included convening industry sector committees. The proposed initiatives create opportunities for all stakeholders to engage in the process, to support their families, and to strengthen their communities.
